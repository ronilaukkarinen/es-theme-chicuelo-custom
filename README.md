### Installation and Updating

To install the theme, use the theme installer built into RetroPie-Setup. You can follow this guide: \
https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/themes

You can also update the theme within RetroPie-Setup: \
RetroPie Setup Script >> Configuration / Tools >> esthemes

**Default theme options - for an improved user experience, once the theme is active, adjust the following options within EmulationStation:**

- UI SETTINGS > CAROUSEL TRANSITIONS: NONE
- UI SETTINGS > TRANSITION STYLE: INSTANT
- UI SETTINGS > ON-SCREEN HELP: OFF

**However, if you wish to enable the on-screen help change the following option:**

- UI SETTINGS > ON-SCREEN HELP: ON

**If you wish to enable a 'slide' effect for the logo when transitioning between systems, change the following option:**

- UI SETTINGS > CAROUSEL TRANSITIONS: ON

### Compatibility

**This theme is designed for a 16:9 aspect ratio. Currently the theme is not fully compatible with a 4:3 aspect ratio.** It has been tested with both 1080p (1920x1080) and 720p (1280x720) resolutions. Other 16:9 resolutions will likely work with no issue due to the scaling that EmulationStation performs.

Tested on Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu based x86 PCs.

### Theme Notes

This theme supports video. You can also use a scraped image in conjunction with the video. If you scrape both, when a game is selected, it will show the screenshot for a couple of seconds before fading and playing the video.

The dot indicator is not included in the theme - it is just a fake indicator made for my personal use, so it will not work correctly on your setup.

Game screenshots are not included within the theme. You can scrape your own - you should use game boxart/screenshots and/or videos.

### Using an Alternative System

There are various ways of using an alternative system instead of the primary system (TurboGrafx-16 instead of PC-Engine for example), but here is one example:

RetroPie uses a file called platforms.cfg to generate the system configurations for es_systems.cfg. You can create a custom platforms.cfg and this will override the default system for regional variants such as the Sega Genesis instead of Megadrive, TurboGrafx instead of PC-Engine, Magnavox Odyssey instead of the Videopac, etc.

To do this, create a platforms.cfg in: \
/opt/retropie/configs/all/platforms.cfg

name, extensions, platform (used by es for scraping), and the theme can be overridden, see [HERE](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/blob/master/platforms.cfg) for the default platforms.cfg

However, the below is an example of changing the theme elements only. Here is a valid platforms.cfg:

megadrive_theme="genesis"  
nes_theme="famicom"  
pcengine_theme="tg16" 
sega32x_theme="mega32x" 
segacd_theme="megacd"  
snes_theme="sfc"  
videopac_theme="odyssey2"

**Note that with any custom platforms.cfg you create, you'll need to update at least one emulator for every system you changed in order to generate a new es_systems.cfg with the changes from platforms.cfg.**
